I unfortunately did not have enough time to fully implement gameplay elements although I began
working on a player ship which can be seen in the project editor as a Player blueprint class.

The idea I intended to make (and still intend to after the term ends when I have more time), was
to have the player ship be able to fly around and shoot down the enemy ships in a Star-Wars style
outer space dog-fight.

The boids algorithm is fully implemented with all 3 rules as well as a bounding rule to keep them within
a defined radius that can be changed in the editor.
